# A CmdStan + Julia implementation for Robust Gaussian Processes in Stan

This repo contains CmdStan + Julia implementations for Michael Betancourt's a great [case study](https://github.com/betanalpha/knitr_case_studies), Robust Gaussian Processes in Stan [[1]](https://betanalpha.github.io/assets/case_studies/gp_part1/part1.html) [[2]](https://betanalpha.github.io/assets/case_studies/gp_part2/part2.html) [[3]](https://betanalpha.github.io/assets/case_studies/gp_part3/part3.html). Since I'm not a R fan, I implement it using Julia and share as reference.

## Notebooks

Notebooks don't include text materials, see Betancourt's original case studies blog to get detail.
